## How to submit your code
- Fork this project

- Include tests, if you have them, and a Rakefile that can run the tests. 
- Include a Gemfile for gem dependencies
- Include a README with:
  - A brief explanation of what the code does your concrete objectives for the code. This could be either:
    - A small feature you want to add; or
    - Something about the existing code which troubles you and which you'd like to improve. Be specific!
